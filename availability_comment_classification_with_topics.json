But `violate` doesn't seem enough because `needToRefreshCreds` is set to `false` in this executor thread, and set to `true` in other threads.\r\n\r\nBetween checking if `needToRefreshCreds` is true and setting it to be `false` in the executor thread, `needToRefreshCreds` could be modified to `true` in other threads but this information is lost.\r\n",

There isn't a perfect solution for our \"deterministically encodable surrogate for read\" problem.\n\nOur solution is: A read is unique upon creation. Any mutation of the read means it's still the same read. A clone of the read is a new read. Users will need to be aware of this convention. It's not ideal, but it's the best we've got. We need to document it everywhere to make sure clients are aware.\n",

        "Comment Body": "I'm a bit concerned about repeating the operation that produces the `MethodHandle` here. To determine that we expect this to work, we need to consider every address-typed IL opcode. A number of them have to be ruled out on the basis that a node with a particular opcode couldn't possibly have a known object constraint (e.g. `new`, `aladd`, `l2a`, `loadaddr`). The remaining opcodes must all expect a symref, and they must all be safe to repeat and guaranteed to produce the same result if repeated (given that it was alright to constrain the result in the first place).\r\n\r\nI expect that currently calls won't get known object constraints on their results, but it's possible that some new analysis could allow us to constrain a call that way in the future. If that were to happen, then any such call with side effects would not (in general) be safe to repeat.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a load that's subject to folding, duplicating the load creates an additional point at which the folding needs to occur (in order to get the intended benefit). That additional folding must be properly tracked and allowed for.\r\n\r\nI think it would be cleaner to transmute the call into a `PassThrough` in order to continue using the original node. It should be relatively straightforward to have the current pass of VP remove the `PassThrough` everywhere it occurs, by adding a handler for it that (constrains and then) returns the child.",

Before this buffer is deallocated, _thread-2_ makes a `deallocate()` call with buffer of size 10 (this is the actual bug). At the time of this deallocation, we will not encounter any problems. But when _thread-1_ makes the `deallocate()` call (and this is a legal call), we would end up throwing (which is bad and would be almost impossible to solve because this wouldn't even be the bug). Ming and I discussed this and decided that silently ignoring this scenario (going over capacity on `deallocate()`) would be better. It does no harm I think.\n",

The `column-reorder` operation can do this.\r\n\r\nAbout the nature of the error: due to the asynchronous nature of Javascript, making HTTP requests in a loop like here tends to be risky, as they will all be fired at the same time (so you do not control in which order they will reach the server). It is better to pass `postCoreProcess` a callback function which will continue making the next calls once the first one has completed. This also holds for the first call above (to `add-column`): you should wait for this HTTP request to complete before deleting the other columns. I suspect that is the reason why you are having issues here: some column removal operation might be executed before the join itself.\r\n\r\nYou can pass a callback to `Refine.postCoreProcess` as follows:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar onJoinSuccess = function() {\r\n    // Do other calls to Refine.postCoreProcess to remove columns here\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar onJoinError = function(e) {\r\n    //\u00a0Report to the user that we could not join the columns for some reason (given in e)\r\n}\r\n\r\nRefine.postCoreProcess(\"add-column\", parameters,\r\n   { expression: self.expression },\r\n   { modelsChanged: true },\r\n   { onDone:onJoinSuccess, onError:onJoinError });\r\n```",

You are really trying to test two separate behaviors, which are of course connected, but still separate:\r\n\r\n1- that `newZooKeeper` throws illegal argument in the case of a parameter change and closes the zk client\r\n2- that the controller reacts correctly to `newZooKeeper` closing the client\r\n\r\nIf we separate the behavior like that, will it be simpler to test? For (1), we simply invoke `newZooKeeper` with a different parameter compared to the ones of the existing client. For (2), we close the zk client and check that the controller restarts correctly. ",
